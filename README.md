This is a web-based application I built for Glenbard West's chapter of the National Honor Society.
It allows users to request to log their hours of volunteer service, and allows administrators to approve those logs.
The aim was to provide quick and easy access to information regarding volunteer activity and additional requirements to both the students and administrators.
This web app was used during the 2015-2016 school year by more than 70 students.

I used ruby and ruby on rails to create this app. Themes were found and modified.
